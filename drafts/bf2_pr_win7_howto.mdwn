Installing and getting Battlefield 2 (an EA game from 2006) to work on Windows 7
is not as easy as it could be. For that reason I wrote this howto to get BF2 and
Project Reality installed and running.

* Install Battlefield 2 from DVD
* Start the game (it will crash)
* Fix the crash by changing the display refresh rate in the profile
  * Goto C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\Battlefield 2\Profiles\Default
  * Open Video.con with Notepad
  * Change VideoSettings.setResolution from 1600x1200@85Hz to 1600x1200@60Hz
  * Goto C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\Battlefield 2\Profiles\001
  * Open Video.con with Notepad
  * Change VideoSettings.setResolution from 1600x1200@85Hz to 1600x1200@60Hz
* Start the game (it should work now) and quit
* Add missing key in registry for update
  * Run regedit
  * Goto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Electronic Arts\EA Games\Battlefield 2
  * Edit -> New -> String Value, Enter: Version
  * Right click on Version -> Modify, Enter: 1.0
