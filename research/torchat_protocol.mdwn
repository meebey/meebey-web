[[!meta title="TorChat Protocol Dissection"]]

***DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a specification but an external _analyses_ of the
TorChat protocol by stuyding the (Java) [source code implementation][source] of
it!*** I am _not_ related to the Tor or TorChat projects. I simply try to cover
the protocol as correctly as possible but don't cry if it contains errors or is
incomplete. I am using this as base for a C# based implementation for use in the
[Smuxi Messenger][smuxi].
