## About ##

leveldb-sharp is a portable C# binding for the C API of the [LevelDB library].

To support the most reach leveldb-sharp is available under the 3-clause BSD
license, which is the same license LevelDB uses.

In case you wonder why I use the C API over the C++ API, the reason is
portability. Using C++/CLI would have been the direct route but it is currently
not portable outside of Windows. As I need the binding for Linux, Windows
and OS X, the C API was the better pick.

## Features ##

leveldb-sharp offers:
 * [low-level function calls] to LevelDB
 * [high-level object oriented API] with .NET enrichments (IEnumerable, IDisposable)
   * DB API
   * Options API
   * Cache API
 * Allows combined use of low-level and high-level APIs
 * NUnit test-case coverage

## Limitations ##

Currently leveldb-sharp lacks:
 * high-level iterator API
 * writebatch API
 * comparator API
 * compact range API
