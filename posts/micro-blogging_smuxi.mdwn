You are wondering if forgot my password of the blogging account? No
I didn't, I just don't have much time to do blogging. I try to
invest more time to just do things than to talk about what I have
done or will do. Blogging needs time: you need a topic to blog
about, you have to login, make a point, do spellchecking and so on.
The result: you see about every 3 months a blog post from me. Don't
get me wrong, I am doing geeky stuff **every** single day (except
when I am on vacation maybe, but that was how many years ago,
eh?).  
**Micro-Blogging** to the rescue! You probably know micro-blogging
ala [twitter.com][] already, but for me thats something new
![wink.png][] You just post a single message with no more than 140
characters and you are **done**. So if you want to follow my
activities, feel free to subscribe to my micro-blog found on
twitter: [http://twitter.com/meebey][]

**Smuxi** is doing nice progress now, I made 2 important changes to
archive constant progress: switch from [Subversion][] to [Git][]
and with that switch from [Trac][] to [Redmine][]. Now everything
is kept in feature-branches and I can switch more often between
features and bug fixes without messing all up. More details about
this can be found in [this Smuxi blog post][].
