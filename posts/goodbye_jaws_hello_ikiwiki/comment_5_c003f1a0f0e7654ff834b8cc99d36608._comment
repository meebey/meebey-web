Hi,

I have been thinking of using the ikiwiki for some time now. I have been trying to see some examples of similar sites. However, except for Joey Hess's site, I haven't seen anything else. Its not easy to notice, since their is no explicit mention of the it anywhere on the site.

Hence my question. Is this site ikiwiki? If it is, it is really good I would say!
