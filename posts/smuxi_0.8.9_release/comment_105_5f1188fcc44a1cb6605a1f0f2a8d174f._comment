Having said all of that, I wonder if Ande's idea isn't the best (regardless of what format you choose to go with for the blog). If it was still public with no comments, but you cross-posted entries in a private forum, you could allow people to respond and discuss in a controlled/private environment, but still keep the blog itself public. I'm not sure how much extra work that would be for you, but if it was negligible I would say that's the best option for running your site the way you have and seem to love, but keeping the riffraff at bay., <a href=\"http://rihannapussy4.typepad.com\">rihanna pussy</a>,  iuce, <a href=\"http://aishwaryaraipornqo.tumblr.com\">aishwarya rai porn</a>,  =-), <a href=\"http://mollysimsnudebb.tumblr.com\">molly sims nude</a>,  himz, <a href=\"http://camillabellenude3.typepad.com\">camilla belle nude</a>,  :-D, <a href=\"http://janefondanude3.typepad.com\">jane fonda nude</a>,  0664, <a href=\"http://selenagomeznaked3.typepad.com\">selena gomez naked</a>,  lrmp, <a href=\"http://katvondsextapeua.tumblr.com\">kat von d sex tape</a>,  %],
