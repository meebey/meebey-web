@Anonymous for working SOCKS proxy support you need to upgrade to a [[development build of Smuxi|http://smuxi.im/documentation/running-from-git/]] (0.8.10-dev).

You can find the proxy settings if you enable \"Show Advanced Settings\" in File -> Preferences -> Interface -> General and then in Connection -> Network Proxy
