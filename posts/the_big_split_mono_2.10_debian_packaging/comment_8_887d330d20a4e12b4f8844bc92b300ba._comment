Are you planning to add fsharp packages to the repository? Today I've found that fsharp .deb package [downloadable from here](http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/releases/view/55463) conficts in vesion with mscorlib.dll. So I've recompiled [F#](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp) and it works! :-)

The big problem is to compile F# PowerPack for mono, but it is an another story...
