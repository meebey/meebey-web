Merry Christmas! Happy New Year! Yeah, it's that time of year
again, I am writing a blog post ![bigsmile.png][]. As some of you
have probably already noticed I managed to get
[Smuxi 0.7 released][] a few days ago. Almost all of my Xmas
vacation I was hacking on Smuxi. This is the best Smuxi release
ever (guaranteed!). The most notable features I implemented in the
0.7 release are: Twitter support, handling for high latency
networks (UTMS, WLAN, busy DSL) and an improved IRC experience
through tweaks such as splitting oversized messages and new context
menus. This release also contains very nice contributions from
[David Paleino][] [[2]][] and [ClÃ©ment Bourgeois][]. Both joined
the hackfest during my Xmas vacation and made the hacking sessions
on Smuxi even more fun. Thanks for that guys! [Here][] you can find
a full list of changes.

As everbody likes screenshots and as screenshots say a thousand
words, here they are:

Which direction will Smuxi head in after the 0.7 release? For the
[0.8 release][], I plan to focus on making the IRC support feature
complete. That means we will get DCC, SSL, IPv6 and logging
support. Nothing of that sounds very special but I am already
investigating how Smuxi can be integrated with the promising new
[Zeitgeist project][]. I interviewed one of the developers for
potential communication between Smuxi and Zeitgeist.

Last but not least, I want to announce that I will be attending
[FOSDEM 2010][] in Brussels. I also will give a
[talk about Smuxi][] there, scheduled on 2010-02-07 at 16:30. If
you want to have a chat, a beer, do some GPG keysigning, or ask me
any questions, I am available ![bigsmile.png][]
