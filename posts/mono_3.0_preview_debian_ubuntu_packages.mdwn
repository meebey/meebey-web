Just after the [Mono 3.0 release] was announced I started working on Debian
packages and after a couple of days of hard work I already have some preview
packages for you.

The preview packages are currently limited to the AMD64 architecture but can be
installed on Debian/Testing (Wheezy), Debian/Unstable (Sid) and
Ubuntu/Quantal (12.10).
After these preview packages have received some successful feedback (please
leave feedback via comments!), I will upload them to Debian/Experimental.

In case you are shocked why I have packages in just 8 days after the official
[Mono 3.0 release], there are 3 factors that play a big role:

 1. New packaging workflow
  * Downstream patches are management in [git branches]
  * Release Early, Release Often: I no longer port and test every patch
    very carefully (especially with architecture specific patches), instead I
    port them with my best knowledge and upload them to [debian.meebey.net]
    and/or Debian/Experimental and use that as test ground. If regressions
    happen, let them happen, and make further uploads to address them.
 2. New packaging style
  * Starting with [my Mono 2.10 packages], each library has it's own package,
    which simplifies packaging.
 3. Sponsored packaging
  * As my [employer] needs Mono packages for an upcoming software project, I was
    granted to work on Mono packages in worktime.

## Install instructions ##

**OBLIGATORY WARNING: DO NOT USE THESE PREVIEW PACKAGES ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS NOR
BLAME ME IF YOUR MONO SOFTWARE NO LONGER WORKS!**

Add this line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

    deb http://debian.meebey.net/experimental/mono /

Now update the APT database and install mono-complete from that repository:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install mono-complete

**UPDATE:** Some people reported issues with xsp4 on Mono 3.0 that look like
this:

    An exception has occurred while generating HttpException page:
    System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
      at System.Web.Util.HttpEncoder.GetCustomEncoderFromConfig () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0
      at System.Lazy`1[System.Web.Util.HttpEncoder].InitValue () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0

I could track these issue down to an too old XSP version. The issue can be
[solved][xsp-fix] by building XSP from the [git repository][xsp-git]. This was
also the reason I couldn't upload the preview packages to the official
repositories.

**UPDATE2:** I have updated the [debian.meebey.net] repository with Mono 3.0.6
packages. An upload to Debian/Experimental and Ubuntu/Raring will happen very
soonish as promised. The final packages for official inclusion need updated
[copyright information] and [library versioning] as defined in the
[Debian Policy] and [Debian CLI Policy]. Have fun Mono 3.0.6ing!
