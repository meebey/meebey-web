Hi,
In mono 2.8 I can run my application, but then install this version and now I'm getting this:

An exception has occurred while generating HttpException page:
System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
  at System.Web.Util.HttpEncoder.GetCustomEncoderFromConfig () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 
  at System.Lazy`1[System.Web.Util.HttpEncoder].InitValue () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 

The actual exception which was being reported was:
System.Web.HttpException:  ---> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object

... and other stuff

What can I do?
Thanks in advance for help me.
