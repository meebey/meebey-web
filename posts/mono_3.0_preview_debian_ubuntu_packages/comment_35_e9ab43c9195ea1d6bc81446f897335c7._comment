This needs to be bumped to 3.2.5.  3.0 to 3.2 was not a minor release.  It encompasses many months of hard work, and id love to see this go to debian main. 

2.10 is archaic and needs to be deprecated.  2.10 and 3.0 branches are no longer maintained or supported by Xamarin.

Also, where can I get the source for this package you've made?
