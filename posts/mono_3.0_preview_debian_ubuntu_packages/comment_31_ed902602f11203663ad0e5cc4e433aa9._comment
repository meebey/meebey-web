THank you for this great work.  I was able to install on ubuntu 12 machine with no problems.  I ran program in monodevelop and some of my bugs were fixed (listview double click no longer crashes).  

Some bugs remain for me (having trouble with UDP)

Any idea if you will be able to get newer versions of mono packaged in this way.  apt-get is great for a noob like me.  I notice current version is 3.2.5

Thanks

GB
