Last night I wanted to buy [an album] on [Amazon] and I couldn't do the
checkout as the site required me to install the Amazon MP3 Downloader to make
the purchase and download of the album. The downloader is not needed for a
single song though, but buying each song separately would be more expensive and
more work. The good news is that it automatically offered me packages for
different Linux distros: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and OpenSUSE instead of telling
me off for using Linux and leaving me behind with a Windows only download.
But here comes the catch, all offered packages are only for the Intel 32-bit
architecture.

Now this is a showstopper for me, as I am running an AMD64 Debian which is a
64-bit architecture. I first tried to download and run the [32-bit debian
package] nonetheless as there was some hope with the ia32-libs and ia32-libs-gtk
package. But this was not working as the application needs gtkmm libraries like
libglademm and bailed when I tried to run it. So I filed
[a wishlist bug report] [#623936] against ia32-libs-gtk for inclusion of gtkmm
and possibly other needed libraries to run the Amazon MP3 downloader on AMD64.

So I bought the album using [MusicLoad] instead which simply puts all songs in
a single archive on-the-fly and let me download that archive.

When I tweeted [my frustration on Twitter] [tweet] I was hinted by [Jo Shields]
and also by [Gabriel Burt] that there would have been a much simpler solution to
this issue by using [Banshee] which includes an Amazon MP3 Store plugin:

[[!img images/banshee_amazon_mp3_store_small.png

alt="Banshee screenshot showing the Amazon MP3 Store plugin"]]

This plugin allows you to log into your Amazon account browse their store like
the regular Amazon store, plays the song samples directly, purchase songs,
downloads the songs and imports them into Banshee's database so you can play
them right away. And as if this wasn't good enough yet, with the the purchase
of MP3 songs on Amazon using Banshee automatically makes a [donation to
the GNOME foundation].

As I am the only one who forgot or [wasn't aware] [0] of this awesome solution
this deserved some blogging.

Update: some people pointed out that [clamz] is also available to make MP3
purchases on Amazon.
