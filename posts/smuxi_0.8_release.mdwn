5 weeks after the 0.7.2.2 "Lovegood" release, I am very happy to announce the
major feature release, **0.8** codenamed **"Godsend"**. Major feature
highlights of this release are desktop notifications (with full support of
actions, icons, updates, append and sound), messaging menu / indicators (as
provided by Ubuntu's [Ayatana project][1]) and working Twitter support with
OAuth (basic auth was disabled by Twitter on 31st August). This version also
fixes all bugs that were reported since the release of 0.7.2.2.

Further on, Smuxi comes with the following improvements in its user
interface:

  * More distinct nick colors by using a combination of colors
  * Use of nick colors for userlists
  * Emphasis of own nick in bold, making it easier to distinguish sent messages
  * Toggle-able menubar
  * Full screen mode support for enhanced netbook experience
  * Browse mode support
  * Remembering of tab order when reconnecting to a smuxi-server
  * Sound support by notification daemons which support this extension
  * Display of IRC network name instead of hostname in the tab
  * Addition of "Open Log" button for easy viewing of logs.

Smuxi provides better connectivity and security by supporting: HTTP and SOCKS
proxies as well as secure connections to IRC servers by using SSL with
optional certificate validation.

Last but not least, it comes with an enhanced Twitter experience by supporting
the use of multiple Twitter accounts at the same time, reformatting tweets
that contain newlines and showing the full retweet instead of a truncated
version.

Updated languages includes: French (Cl√©ment BOURGEOIS) and German (Bianca Mix)

The [#smuxi IRC channel][4] can now also be found, in addition to OFTC, on
other popular IRC networks such as freenode and GIMPnet. The messages on
 #smuxi are automatically relayed between the 3 IRC networks.

If you like Smuxi and want to support it by making micro-donations, [Smuxi is
available on Flattr][5].

There are also many other nice FOSS projects available on Flattr, see the
[Flattr-FOSS project][6].

Smuxi is available for download from [here][7].

Binary Packages of Smuxi 0.8 are ready to be used by Debian/Experimental,
Ubuntu/Maverick, Ubuntu/Lucid (via PPA), OpenSUSE, Foresight Linux, FreeBSD,
and Windows.
