Wow! That was easy! Installed from Ubuntu Software Center, clicked on link for US on Clamz homepage (http://code.google.com/p/clamz/), clicked on the download button from Amazon page that appeared, and was prompted to open with clamz, and command prompt opened and automatically downloaded the entire album!!! Done!
